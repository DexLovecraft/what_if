                <p>
                    Throughout his schooling, Kim was involved in politics. He was active in the Korean Children's Union and the Democratic Youth League of North Korea (DYL), taking part in study groups of Marxist political theory and other literature. In September 1957, he became vice-chairman of his middle school's DYL branch (the chairman had to be a teacher). He pursued a programme of anti-factionalism and attempted to encourage greater ideological education among his classmates.

                    However, Norwood stated that Kardashian, along with her sisters Khloé and Kourtney, had allegedly made over $120,000 in unauthorized charges, with the bulk attributed to purchases made at Kardashian's family owned boutique in 2006 and 2007, after Kardashian was no longer employed by the singer. Norwood stated that she did not file criminal charges at the request of her children and presented her findings to Kardashian directly who allegedly apologized and promised to repay the accumilated debt. By 2008, no attempts to repay were forthcoming so Norwood filed a civil lawsuit. Kardashian has denied all allegations.

                    Räikkönen was born in Espoo, Finland. He had a long line of success in karting from the age of 10. His first race outside Finland was in Monaco when he was 15 years old. During the race, the steering wheel broke, but he continued, informing his mechanic by frantically waving the steering wheel in the air on the home straight. Räikkönen's next Monaco race was also memorable; he was thrown on the wrong side of the safety fence in a first lap collision but continued driving until running out of road. Undeterred, he lifted his kart back onto the track and continued to race. His mechanic thought Räikkönen had retired, but he eventually caught up with the other competitors and finished third.
